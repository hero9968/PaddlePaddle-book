In our implementation,\nwe use vectors to reprenset these diagonal weight matrices. The b terms\ndenote bias vectors ($b_i$ is the input gate bias vector), $\\sigma$\nis the non-line activations, such as logistic sigmoid function, and\n$i, f, o$ and $c$ are the input gate, forget gate, output gate,\nand cell activation vectors, respectively, all of which have the same size as\nthe cell output activation vector $h$.\n\nThe $\\odot$ is the element-wise product of the vectors. $act_g$ and $act_h$\nare the cell input and cell output activation functions and `tanh` is usually\nused for them. $\\tilde{c_t}$ is also called candidate hidden state,\nwhich is computed based on the current input and the previous hidden state.\n\nSet `use_peepholes` False to disable peephole connection. The formula\nis omitted here, please refer to the paper\nhttp://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf for details.\n\nNote that these $W_{xi}x_{t}, W_{xf}x_{t}, W_{xc}x_{t}, W_{xo}x_{t}$\noperations on the input $x_{t}$ are NOT included in this operator.\nUsers can choose to use fully-connect operator before LSTM operator.\n\n",

The key point\nis that the listed equations are satisfied by ids.\n\n    tag_type = label % num_tag_type\n    chunk_type = label / num_tag_type\n\nwhere `num_tag_type` is the num of tag types in the tagging scheme, `num_chunk_type`\nis the num of chunk types, and `tag_type` get its value from the following table.\n\n    Scheme Begin Inside End   Single\n     plain   0     -      -     -\n     IOB     0     1      -     -\n     IOE     -     0      1     -\n     IOBES   0     1      2     3\n\nStill use NER as example, assuming the tagging scheme is IOB while chunk types are ORG,\nPER and LOC. To satisfy the above equations, the label map can be like this:\n\n    B-ORG  0\n    I-ORG  1\n    B-PER  2\n    I-PER  3\n    B-LOC  4\n    I-LOC  5\n    O      6\n\nIt’s not hard to verify the equations noting that the num of chunk types\nis 3 and the num of tag types in IOB scheme is 2. For example, the label\nid of I-LOC is 5, the tag type id of I-LOC is 1, and the chunk type id of\nI-LOC is 2, which consistent with the results from the equations.\n",

CRF learns the conditional probability $P(Y|X)$, where\n$X = (x_1, x_2, ... , x_n)$ are structured inputs and\n$Y = (y_1, y_2, ... , y_n)$ are labels for the inputs.\n\nLinear chain CRF is a special case of CRF that is useful for sequence labeling\ntask. Sequence labeling tasks do not assume a lot of conditional\nindependences among inputs. The only constraint they impose is that the input\nand output must be linear sequences. Thus, the graph of such a CRF is a simple\nchain or a line, which results in the linear chain CRF.\n\nThis operator implements the Forward-Backward algorithm for the linear chain\nCRF. Please refer to http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/fb.pdf and\nhttp://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~elkan/250Bwinter2012/loglinearCRFs.pdf for details.\n\nEquation:\n1. Denote Input(Emission) to this operator as $x$ here.\n2. The first D values of Input(Transition) to this operator are for starting\nweights, denoted as $a$ here.\n3. The next D values of Input(Transition) of this operator are for ending\nweights, denoted as $b$ here.\n4. The remaning values of Input(Transition) are for transition weights,\ndenoted as $w$ here.\n5. Denote Input(Label) as $s$ here.\n\nThe probability of a sequence $s$ of length $L$ is defined as:\n$$P(s) = (1/Z) \\exp(a_{s_1} + b_{s_L}\n                + \\sum_{l=1}^L x_{s_l}\n                + \\sum_{l=2}^L w_{s_{l-1},s_l})$$\n\nwhere $Z$ is a normalization value so that the sum of $P(s)$ over\nall possible sequences is 1, and $x$ is the emission feature weight\nto the linear chain CRF.\n\nFinally, the linear chain CRF operator outputs the logarithm of the conditional\nlikelihood of each training sample in a mini-batch.\n\nNOTE:\n1. The feature function for a CRF is made up of the emission features and the\ntransition features. The emission feature weights are NOT computed in\nthis operator. They MUST be computed first before this operator is called.\n\n2. Because this operator performs global normalization over all possible\nsequences internally, it expects UNSCALED emission feature weights.\nPlease do not call this op with the emission feature being output of any\nnonlinear activation.\n\n3. The 2nd dimension of Input(Emission) MUST be equal to the tag number.\n\n",

This operator was \nintroduced in the following paper for DeepSpeech2:\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dyogatam/papers/wang+etal.iclrworkshop2016.pdf \n\nThe main motivation is that a bidirectional RNN, useful in DeepSpeech \nlike speech models, learns representation for a sequence by performing a \nforward and a backward pass through the entire sequence. However, unlike \nunidirectional RNNs, bidirectional RNNs are challenging to deploy in an online\nand low-latency setting. The lookahead convolution incorporates information \nfrom future subsequences in a computationally efficient manner to improve \nunidirectional recurrent neural networks. The row convolution operator is \ndifferent from the 1D sequence convolution, and is computed as follows:\n\nGiven an input sequence $in$ of length $t$ and input dimension $d$, \nand a filter ($W$) of size $context \\times d$, \nthe output sequence is convolved as:\n\n$$\nout_{i, :} = \\sum_{j=i}^{i + context} in_{j,:} \\dot W_{i-j, :}\n$$\n\n",
